##Description

Quecker is a basic queue managing application written in java.
I did this as a side-project and I wish for others to review and contribute to what I've done.
The front-end/GUI is only for debugging purposes, importing not being recommended.
This is structured as a maven project. All the dependencies are handled.
THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE A STANDALONE APPLICATION.

##Instructions for bug reporting

- Optizations are encouraged
- Exceptions --> post stacktrace
- Bug reports must contain instructions on how to reproduce the bug. This is the single most important point. Bugs that can't be reproduced can't be fixed either.

##Change log
- 0.0.1:
	* uploaded the project :)
	* not released

##Rules (for pull requests)

- Every method and class (except for getter, setters, maybe toString's ...) from this project has a javadoc and I intend to keep it that way.
- Any new dependencies should be resolved in the pom.xml
- Any feedback is accepted.
- Contributors are added to a contributor list
- Be creative & have fun!
